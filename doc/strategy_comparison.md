## How Each Strategy Works

### 1. üèÜ Momentum-Based Strategy (3 games, 0.2 threshold)

**Concept**: Bet on teams with winning momentum and against teams with losing momentum based on recent streaks.

**How it works**:
- **Momentum calculation**: Analyzes consecutive wins/losses over last 3 games
- **Winning momentum**: Bet FOR teams with momentum ‚â• 0.2 (recent winning streak)
- **Losing momentum**: Bet AGAINST teams with momentum ‚â§ -0.2 (recent losing streak)
- **Dynamic selection**: Teams selected based on current form, not past season performance

**Example**: If Chelsea won 2 of last 3 games, they have positive momentum. If Arsenal lost 2 of last 3, they have negative momentum.

**Performance**:
- **Total**: 12,841 bets, 54.0% win rate, +83.6% ROI (+10,732 units)
- **Best seasons**: 2018 (+665 units), 2021 (+550 units), 2017 (+549 units)
- **Consistency**: 100% profitable seasons

### 2. ü•à Form-Based Strategy (3 games, 0.6 threshold)

**Concept**: Bet on teams with good recent form and against teams with poor form.

**How it works**:
- **Form calculation**: Points earned over last 3 games divided by maximum possible points
- **Good form**: Bet FOR teams with form ‚â• 0.6 (60% of maximum points)
- **Poor form**: Bet AGAINST teams with form < 0.6
- **Dynamic selection**: Teams selected based on recent performance

**Example**: Team earning 7 points from last 3 games (2 wins, 1 draw) has form score of 7/9 = 0.78.

**Performance**:
- **Total**: 9,527 bets, 55.6% win rate, +75.8% ROI (+7,224 units)
- **Best seasons**: 2023 (+418 units), 2017 (+424 units), 2024 (+407 units)
- **Consistency**: 100% profitable seasons

### 3. ü•â Top-Bottom Strategy (N=3)

**Concept**: Bet FOR the top 3 teams from the previous season and AGAINST the bottom 3 teams.

**How it works**:
- **FOR bets**: Bet on top 3 teams to win their matches
- **AGAINST bets**: Bet against bottom 3 teams (bet on their opponents)
- **Selection**: Based on previous season's final league table
- **Static selection**: Teams selected once per season based on past performance

**Example**: If Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool were top 3 in 2023, bet on them to win in 2024.

**Performance**:
- **Total**: 4,702 bets, 65.5% win rate, +70.6% ROI (+3,319 units)
- **FOR bets**: 2,564 bets, 62.1% win rate, -5.0% ROI (-129 units)
- **AGAINST bets**: 2,138 bets, 69.6% win rate, +161.3% ROI (+3,448 units)
- **Consistency**: 100% profitable seasons

### 4. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Home-Away Strategy

**Concept**: Bet on the home team to win every match.

**How it works**:
- **Simple approach**: Always bet on the home team
- **No analysis**: No consideration of team strength, form, or other factors
- **Baseline**: Provides a baseline for comparison with more sophisticated strategies

**Performance**:
- **Total**: 9,025 bets, 45.7% win rate, -3.3% ROI (-301 units)
- **Consistency**: Only 41.7% profitable seasons
